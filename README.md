Battleship2


Overview
The game consists of two main parts: the player's board and the computer's board. Players can place their ships on their board by clicking on the desired location. Once all ships are placed, 
the computer will randomly place its ships on its board. The game proceeds with players taking turns to guess the coordinates of the opponent's ships. 
The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game.

How to Play

1.Open the index.html file in your web browser.

2.Click on the cells of your board to place your ships.

3.Once all ships are placed, the computer will automatically place its ships.

4.Click on the cells of the computer's board to guess the location of the opponent's ships.
Continue taking turns until all ships on one board are sunk.

The game will display messages indicating hits, misses, and the winner.
Code Structure
index.html: Contains the structure of the game interface.
style.css: Stylesheet for the game interface.
script.js: JavaScript file containing the game logic and functionality.

5. To reset the game and start over:

Click the "Reset" button.

All ships will be removed from the boards, and players can start placing their ships again.


Next Steps: 

- Once the rest of the game logic is functioning properly I would like to add in some animations when a player or computer attacks a grid - point.
- I would also like to add a hit counter for both the player and computer boards.
